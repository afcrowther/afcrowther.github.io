I'm a London based software developer with experience working with a variety of large scale distributed systems.

Since I first began working with code, I've always found blogs and articles written and shared by others in the software development community to be an amazing resource - some of the best of which I have linked [here]({% link _pages/links.md %}). I thought it was time I added to that global network with some content of my own, so here we are.

I feel that writing and sharing content is a great way to force yourself to really dig into topics to a level that you may otherwise not have - if only in an attempt to not make a fool out of yourself! It is to that end that I initially wanted to create this blog, but, if anyone else happens to stumble across it and find something useful, that's obviously an added bonus :)
