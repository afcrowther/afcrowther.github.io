This is an attempt to recreate some of the Netty library for the purpose of learning at a deeper level what frameworks like this are doing for me.

The source code (a work in progress*) can be found [here](https://github.com/afcrowther/netty-from-scratch).

This project comes along with a blog post series, of which the first post can be found [here]({% link _posts/2020-05-22-Netty-from-scratch.md %}).
